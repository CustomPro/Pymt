# Pymt
Pymt is a mobile point of sale system with a web backend for managing inventory and menu items

#SOW
• Both Mobile and Web applications should be built using React.js, GraphQL, and React-Native both with Redux, and OWASP security standards. For native we have a library with the UI we have chosen ready to go.
• All data calls used by the application should use JWT for security.
• The card reader (bluetooth) will have a SDK that will need to be wrapped for React-Native to use and make payment calls.
• There will be a network and wireless printers with SDK that the devices should connect to and print. On the following mobile and web screens I will go over each screen and any specifics on each one.
• In general files should be short and use React’s import function to make shared components where applicable, no monolithic functions or components. Make logical separations for each need.
